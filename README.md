# Foxconn_Pino_study_project
study Foxconn ai text book from my relatives at I'm 17 years-old 2025
I'm interested in AI, and luckily, my uncle-in-law is an AI instructor.
He gave me a book as a gift to encourage me — that’s when I started reading and experimenting.
In Part_1.py, I'm learning the basics of neural networks:
standard FNN (feedforward neural networks), CNN (convolutional neural networks), and RNN (recurrent neural networks).
Instead of just watching videos, I wanted to understand how the math works, and actually build the models myself.
So this repo is my way of learning — by coding, failing, and trying again.
