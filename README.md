Reference book: *AI Introduction* by Foxconn, provided by the author’s relatives.

Hello, I'm maja-ja, a 17-year-old homeschooling student living in central Taiwan.  
I started learning AI (Artificial Intelligence) in July 2025.
I'm a macOS user.

In `Part_1.py`, you can learn data analysis methods, various algorithms, and basic types of neural networks, including:  
- **KNN** – K-Nearest Neighbors  
- **K-means** – K-means Clustering  
- **FNN** – Feedforward Neural Networks  
- **CNN** – Convolutional Neural Networks  
- **RNN** – Recurrent Neural Networks  

In `Part_2.py`(haven't created),you can learn about image recognition, video recognition, and deep neural networks (DNN).

In `Part_3.py`(haven't created), you can learn about audio recognition and natural language processing (NLP).

In folder `images`, you can see lots of pictures, file type including: .jpg, .jpeg, .png. These files will be file`test2.py`'s material.

`README.md` literally, read me. :)

`dataset_index.json` put word-picture-number data from `test2.py`.

`github_help.txt` some bash command for maja-ja own use.

`root.py` a launcher launch another python files which according number in `root.txt`.

`root.txt` only has numbers in.

`test1.py` please go to this file to understand what file do. (i don't know how to explain.)

`test2.py` same of text of `test1.py`

`wordbase.json` record data from `test1.py`.
