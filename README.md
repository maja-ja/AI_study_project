# Foxconn_Pino_Study_Project

Study Foxconn AI textbook from my relatives — I'm 17 years old, learning in 2025.

I'm interested in AI, and luckily, my uncle-in-law is an AI instructor.  
He gave me a book as a gift to encourage me — that’s when I started reading and experimenting.

In Part_1.py, I'm learning the basics of neural networks, including:

- FNN – Feedforward Neural Networks  
- CNN – Convolutional Neural Networks  
- RNN – Recurrent Neural Networks  

Instead of just watching videos, I wanted to understand how the math works,  
and actually build the models myself.

So this repo is my way of learning — by coding, failing, and trying again.
