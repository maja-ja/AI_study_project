Hello, I'm maja-ja, a 17-year-old homeschooling student living in central Taiwan.  
I started learning AI (Artificial Intelligence) in July 2025.

In `Part_1.py`, you can learn data analysis methods, various algorithms, and basic types of neural networks, including:  
- **KNN** – K-Nearest Neighbors  
- **K-means** – K-means Clustering  
- **FNN** – Feedforward Neural Networks  
- **CNN** – Convolutional Neural Networks  
- **RNN** – Recurrent Neural Networks  

In `Part_2.py`, you can learn about image recognition, video recognition, and deep neural networks (DNN).

In `Part_3.py`, you can learn about audio recognition and natural language processing (NLP).

In folder `images`, you can see lots of pictures, file type including: .jpeg, .png,
